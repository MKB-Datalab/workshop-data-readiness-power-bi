# Program Data Readiness - Workshop Introduction to Power BI


This repository is part of the MKB Datalab  `Data Readiness Program`.  It contains support material used during the Power BI session offered to 
students participating of this program.

During these hands-on session students will learn some concepts of Power BI while building a simple dashboard. This might be used during the program as 
basis to get a standardized Dashboard for each participating SME.

Furthermore, during this session we introduce some real datasets and point out some of the challenges that might be encountered when working with real data.
